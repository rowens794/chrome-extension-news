I'm developing a chrome extension an i need some help.

First let me tell you what i want it to do. I want users to be able to easily create summaries of the articles they are reading using LLMs (probably google's gemini).

I'd like my users to have an option show up on a webpage they are reading and if it is determined that the page is an article, they can click the button and a summary will be generated in a pane to the right side of the article.

Because the summarization can take a while (up to 30 seconds), I'd like to send the request off to the LLM immediately upon the page loading. The button for the user should show immediately, but it should also indicate if it is loading (i.e. waiting on a response from the model).

I'd like to be able to develop the pluging using dedicated html/css/js files to the extent possible.

I've never built and extension before and need some help on the concepts/file structure/boiler plate code.

Can you help me get started?
